## PROJECT: ANGELCOINS

The demo app is meant to allow a user to invest in startup stocks using cryptocurrency. 
You can click on the different list of companies to see trend of each company's value displayed by the chart.
 
This project uses new standards in ReactJS technology including:
- REACT HOOKS - Newest hooks feature in React that allow for cleaner code writing and functional components.
- REDUX & REDUX HOOKS - For global state management using the new hooks for redux.
- RESTful API - integration supported by a NodeJS backend that I have also written.
- MATERIAL-UI - UI kit by Google
- CI/CD - FrontEnd continuously deployed using Netlify

The backend for dashboard is populated using a RESTful API that was also created by me.
The backend was written using NodeJS and uses a MongoDB database.
